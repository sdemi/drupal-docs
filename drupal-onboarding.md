At first, I would familiarize yourself with the Acquia Certified Developer certification on Drupal 8 here: https://www.acquia.com/customer-success/learning-services/acquia-certification-program. Just get to know the contents of the certification and what you would be expected to know as a full stack Drupal developer. This will help guide you in the Drupal trainings as you become more familiar with Drupal. If you attempt to pass the exam, this will be highly desirable for your career as this is a highly sought after certification and is the gold standard in the Drupal community.

As you will tell from the certification contents, Drupal is basically divided into 3 parts:
* Site building
* Theming (front-end development)
* Module development (back-end development)

It gets more and more complicated as you go from top to bottom. For site building, register for a partner account on their Acquia Academy platform here: https://partners.acquiaacademy.com/.

After this, for site building training, I would recommend this course to get you up to speed on site building: https://www.acquiaacademy.com/learn/course/80/drupal-8-building-websites-with-drupal-8. Please use your existing Drupal 8 instance you are hosting on local. I think this is a fairly long course and it covers ALL aspects of Drupal site building.

Further, for theming and module development, I would recommend the Chapter Three training. This training is hands on, uses best practices, and it's from a really good Drupal consultancy (http://chapterthree.com).

They have a couple trainings you should work through:
* Drupal theming - https://github.com/chapter-three/drupal-8-theming
* Drupal backend - https://github.com/chapter-three/drupal-8-backend
